li is a little lisp library and interpreter based on Scheme.

li is the lisp interpreter. libli.a is the li library.

The goal of this project is to provide a very tiny lisp library for embedded
scripting in C applications.

Syntax
======
If you've used a lisp before, the syntax here is nothing new.  If not, find a
Scheme tutorial (or better yet, read SICP) as li is almost identical to Scheme
except for the following differences:

    * Vectors are of the form [...] instead of #(...).
    * Unhygenic macros.

li Reference
============
A reference is coming soon.

C API Reference
===============
A reference is coming soon, but in the meantime the API is documented in li.h.

Bugs
====
    * Syntax checking is not complete.  Bad syntax will result in unknown
      behavior which may include unexpected termination or even segfaults.
