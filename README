subscm, pronounced subscheme, is, as the name is meant to imply, an interpreter
for a small subset of the Scheme programming language.  That is, it's not meant
to be a full-featured R5RS implementation, just a subset of the features I find
the most useful.  My ultimate goal is ease of extensibility so that I may use
it as an embedded configuration and scripting lanaguge in future projects.
