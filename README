subscm is a is very simple Lisp-1 based on Scheme. It started out as a Scheme
implementation, but the spec was more complex and vague than I thought it would
be and didn't include some features that I wanted to implement, so I decided to
create my own Lisp.  It's meant for simple scripts and embedding into C code.
It's pretty far from complete.

What is supported
=================
Data types:
* Booleans
* Chars
* Numbers
* Ports
* Promises
* Strings
* Vectors

Differences between subscm and Scheme
=====================================
* Comments start with bash (#) instead of semicolon (;).
* #t and #f are true and false respectively.
* Booleans are just the symbols true and false, they're not a primitive type.
* Characters are denoted the same way they are in C ('a', 'b', '\n', etc.).
* There's no quote ('), just quasiquote (`) which does the same job.
* Vectors are in the form %(...) instead of #(...).
* There's no numerical tower. All numbers are doubles, like in Javascript.
* No continuations. 
* Macros are not hygenic.

Bugs
====
* Syntax checking is not complete.  Bad syntax will result in unknown behavior
  which may include unexpected termination or even segfaults.
