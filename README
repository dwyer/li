subscm, pronounced subscheme, is, as the name is meant to imply, an interpreter
for a small subset of the Scheme programming language.  That is, it's not meant
to be a full-featured R5RS implementation, just a subset of the features I find
the most useful.  My ultimate goal is ease of extensibility so that I may use
it as an embedded configuration and scripting lanaguge in future projects.

Currently, it's just a toy.  It's capable of running simple programs and
algorithms so long as they're purely functional and don't depend on lexical
scoping.  It supports compound procedures but not closures.  It's hardly even
worth looking at until these issues in particular are resolved.  :)
