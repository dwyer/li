li is the lisp interpreter. libli.a is the li library.

Differences between li and Scheme
=================================
* Comments may start with a bash (#) or semicolon (;), as such...
    * Booleans are `true` and `false` rather than #t and #f.
    * Chars begin with `%\` rather than `#\`.
    * Vectors are of the form [...] instead of #(...).
* Numbers are just doubles, so no bignums or numberical tower.
* No continuations (yet).
* Unhygenic macros.

Bugs
====
* Syntax checking is not complete.  Bad syntax will result in unknown behavior
  which may include unexpected termination or even segfaults.
