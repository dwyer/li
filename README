subscm is a is very simple Lisp-1 based on Scheme.

What is supported
=================
Data types:
* Booleans
* Chars
* Numbers
* Pairs
* Ports
* Strings
* Symbols
* Vectors

Differences between subscm and Scheme
=====================================
* Comments may start with a bash (#) or semicolon (;).
* #t and #f are true and false respectively.
* Booleans are `true' and `false' rather than #t and #f.
* Chars begin with %\ rather than #\
* Vectors are in the form [...] instead of #(...).
* There's no numerical tower. All numbers are doubles, like in Javascript.
* No continuations. 
* Macros are not hygenic.

Bugs
====
* Syntax checking is not complete.  Bad syntax will result in unknown behavior
  which may include unexpected termination or even segfaults.
