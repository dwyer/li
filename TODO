General:
* Improve garbage collector.

Special forms:
* define-syntax
* syntax-rules

Parser:
* trigger syntax errors

Data types:
* Booleans: implemented as symbols, but (symbol? #t) and (symbol? #f) should
  return false.
* Promises: whatever.
* Chars: kinda pointless but simple enough to implement.
* Bignums: nice, but are they worth the added complexity and overhead?
