General:
* Improve garbage collector.

Special forms:
* define-syntax
* syntax-rules

Parser:
* Dotted pairs: currently the parser interprets (1 . 2) as a list containing
  the number 1, the symbol ., and the number 2, whereas it should be a pair
  containing 1 and 2. This should be fixed immediately.

Data types:
* Booleans: implemented as symbols, but (symbol? #t) and (symbol? #f) should
  return false.
* Promises: whatever.
* Chars: kinda pointless but simple enough to implement.
* Bignums: nice, but are they worth the added complexity and overhead?
